### About me

I'm a Front-End Engineer and a User Experience design enthusiast. I lately find myself tinkering with various web libraries, human-centric design patterns, animations, and all sorts of related stuff, including studying case studies to enhance user experience. Feel free to drop by if you would like to discuss on any topic, or just to say hi!

I'm well-versed in building optimized web applications using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I have solid experience working with React and have also scratched the surface of other UI libraries like Angular and Vue. In addition to my profession as a developer, I regularly follow design podcasts, look for ways to explore my design thinking skills - such as through reading books (finished "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug and "Sprint" by Jake Knapp), currently reading "Lean UX" by Jeff Gothelf. Moreover, I'm a proponent of online courses and have recently completed some on UX fundamentals. Lastly, I also read blogs and documentation on industrial practices. Some of my favourite resources are - Google Design (https://design.google) and The Nielsen Norman Group (nngroup.com).
