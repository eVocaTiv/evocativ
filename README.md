### About me ðŸ˜„

I'm a Front-End Engineer, and a User Experience Design enthusiast. I lately find myself tinkering with various web libraries, human-centric design patterns, animations, and all sorts of related stuff, including studying case studies to enhance user experience. Feel free to drop by if you would like to discuss on any topic, or just to say hi!

### Skills & Interests âš¡

- I'm well-versed in building optimized web applications using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
- I have a solid experience in working with React and have also scratched the surface of other UI libraries like Angular and Vue. 
- I have acquired basic knowledge of UX principles, wireframing and prototyping using Adobe XD / Figma, editing and layering using Photoshop and preparing case studies from gathering requirements, creating user personas to documenting focus-group testing and user interviews.

In addition to interests as a developer, I regularly follow design podcasts, and look for ways to expand my design thinking skills - such as through reading books (finished *"Don't Make Me Think"* by Steve Krug and *"Sprint"* by Jake Knapp), currently reading *"Lean UX"* by Jeff Gothelf. Moreover, I'm a proponent of online courses and have recently completed some on UX fundamentals. Lastly, I also read blogs and documentation on industrial practices. 

Some of my favourite resources are -
__[Google Design](https://www.design.google)__ and __[The Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com)__. I consider myself fortunate to be surrounded by extremely talented designers and developers at **Amazon**, from whom I learn new things everyday.

*Other Hobbies*
I'm a connoisseur of music, and a part-time bassist. Presently I'm teaching myself music theory and things like how to produce tracks using a DAW.
